### nodemon (Optional)

nodemon is optional and allows you to use the `npm run dev` command which is ideal in development, nodemon auto restarts on file save.

### PM2 (Optional)

PM2 is optional and allows you to use the `npm run pm2` command which is ideal if you wish to run DEL in production.

### MongoDB

A MongoDB instance is required - it must match the configuration in the `settings.json` file.

### Redis

Redis must be installed for caching to work, the site will not function correctly without it - it must match the configuration in the `settings.json` file.

### NPM Packages
Install all of the dependencies by running `npm i` command.

## Configuration

1. Rename `settings.example.json` to `settings.json` and fill it out appropriately, changing anything you need to change.
2. (Optional) In addition to this you may wish to change some of the things in the `variables.ts` file located in `src/Util/Function`.

## Running DEL

### Compiling

#### First Start

When you first start DEL you will need to run the following command: `npm run compile && npm run editor-compile`

#### Making Changes

Every time you make a change to any of the `.ts` files you will need to run the `npm run compile` command to ensure everything is up to date.

### Production

We reccomend when running DEL in production you use the `npm run pm2` command, however you can still run DEL using the standard `npm run start` command.

### Development/Testing

We reccomend you run DEL using the `npm run start` command.
